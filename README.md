# StomaPictureClf
This repository is for the Stoma project - Dutch Health Hackathon. The goal is to train a model which can classify from the pictures whether patient's stoma has problems and what kind of problems. Then, the mobile app can provide advice to patients what they should do. 

Due to lack of adequate pictures, the model now cannot have a good performance on its accuracy. Once we get more pictures and help from stoma specialist, this model can be sufficiently improved.
